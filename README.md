- The use of ANNs for Regression Tasks!
- Model is preprocessed b/w 0 to 1 using minmaxscaler
- Used activation function 'relu'. Optimizer 'adam' for model compiling with loss reduction 'mean squared error'
- To avoid the overfitting validation split is set to 0.2(with epochs 100,batch_size=25,verbose=1) and evaluted the model.
